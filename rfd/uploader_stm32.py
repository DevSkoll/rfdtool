"""STM32 system-memory bootloader uploader for RFD900x / RFD900ux radios.

These radios use an STM32 MCU whose factory-burned ROM bootloader speaks the
ST USART protocol over the radio's serial port. We don't reimplement that
protocol here - instead, we drive the well-tested ``stm32flash`` CLI as a
subprocess and parse its line-buffered stdout to drive a progress callback.

This module assumes the radio is **already in bootloader mode** by the time
``upload_stm32`` is invoked. The two ways to get it there are out of scope:

* On STM32 SiK builds, the firmware processes ``AT&UPDATE`` and jumps into
  system memory.
* On bare hardware, the BOOT/CTS pin must be held to ground while the radio
  powers up.

Either way, the caller hands us a serial port path that the ROM bootloader
is listening on, plus a ``.bin`` firmware file, and we run::

    stm32flash -b 57600 -e 0xff -w fw.bin -v -g 0x08000000 -S 0x08000000 PORT

and translate ``stm32flash``'s output into ``progress(done, total)`` calls.

The module is stdlib-only.

    The radio is assumed to already be sitting in its STM32 system-memory

    line-by-line, and translate progress lines like
    ``Wrote address 0x08001000 (12.34%)`` into ``progress(done, total)``
    callbacks. ``total`` is taken from ``os.path.getsize(bin_path)``.

    Cancellation is cooperative: when ``cancel_check`` returns truthy between
    output lines, we ``terminate()`` the subprocess, wait briefly for it to
    exit, and raise :class:`STM32FlashCancelled`. Non-zero exit raises
    :class:`STM32FlashError` with the last few lines of merged stdout/stderr
    appended to help diagnose the failure.

    Parameters mirror the spec in the project's docs; see ``_build_args`` for
    how the flags map onto the ``stm32flash`` CLI.

    The ``subprocess_factory`` hook is for tests and accepts the full argv
    list; it must return an object with a ``stdout.readline()`` method, plus
    ``poll()``, ``wait()``, and ``terminate()`` methods compatible with
